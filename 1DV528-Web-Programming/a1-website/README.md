A1 Website
=================

Build your website here. Put all files in the directory `public/`.

Clone the repository using git clone. Open a terminal and type "npm install", then "npm run lint". After you verify that there are no errors, do "npm run http-server" and navigate to the html folder, from which you can open any of the html files. You can then use the navigation bar to navigate the web pages.
