# Reflection on my Intended Design
Follow the instructions and write the report in this file.

* In my suggested class diagram, I was missing a **Game** class, where the game was actually played, as my idea was to have the **Board** as the main class, which could have worked but having the main functionality in a separate class (**Game**) is indeed better.
* I did not have any additional classes in my **Class diagram**, as the classes I had were doing all the work needed, and it was even a good idea to divide them into more classes.
* The only difference between the class names in my and in the given **Class diagram** is "**ConsoleUI**", which I called "**UserInterface**". I do believe that it's an insignificant difference, though. I consider both to be correct.
* The biggest difference in the relations in my and the given **Class diagram** are the **Player**. The given class diagram uses an interface "**Player**", while I had mine be a class, which "**ComputerPlayer**" extends.
* I managed to divide the work in my class diagram between several classes, although it could have been further divided to look like the given class diagram.
* In my object diagram, I had the tiles be in an ArrayList in the **Board** class, in contrast to having them as a circular doubly linked list in the given class diagram. I also had the players call the **Board** class, which then called the Property class instead of a direct relation between Player-Property. 
* The **Sequence diagram** I made is the most different than the one we were given. First of all, I started by manually adding the players and individual tiles, as opposed to having them hardcoded in the code. Next, I had rolling th dice be the last thing a player does. Instead, I first checked what type of **Tile** the player is standing on (**Property** in my diagram), then checked if it has an owner (It did), and finally paid rent to the owner before moving again. Then I printed the **Board** status. It is too different from the one we were given to properly compare but I think it is just another way to do it, rather than a failure. 
* I do think I did a good job with all diagrams, although they were sligthly (**Class** and **Object**) or very (**Sequence**) different than the given ones. I believe that I could have finished the game using that design, which would probably not be as good but it would be working correctly, which I would take as a win for my first diagram.
* The most important thing I learned by designing my diagrams was to think first, visualize the done product and then start making the diagram, piece by piece and not be afraid to introduce significant changes at any point in the process instead of trying to adapt the program to the progress I have made so far.
